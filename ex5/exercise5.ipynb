You will build a practical, AI-powered agent with LangChain, compare it to other frameworks, conceptualize a more advanced ML model, and design a true real-time data streaming solution.\n","\n","#### Scenario\n","The rule-based fraud detection system is operational. Now, you will build a prototype GenAI-powered agent that can answer natural language questions about the transaction data, allowing analysts to investigate fraud more intuitively.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 1: AI/GenAI for Advanced Fraud Detection 🤖\n","\n","#### 1.1 Machine Learning Model for Fraud Detection (Conceptual)\n","Your rule-based system is good, but it can't catch unknown patterns. Propose a machine learning model to complement it.\n","\n","* **Model Selection**: What type of ML model would you choose (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network)? Justify your choice.\n","* **Feature Engineering**: Based on the data we've used all week (`transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `amount`, `timestamp`, `ip_address`, `customer_tier`, `registration_date`), list at least **five** new features you would engineer to train your model. Explain why each feature would be valuable.\n","    * *Example: `transaction_rate_per_hour_for_customer`.*\n","* **Training & Evaluation**: How would you handle the class imbalance problem (far more non-fraudulent than fraudulent transactions)? What key metric(s) would you use to evaluate your model's performance (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC)? Why?\n","\n","#### 1.2 Practical LangChain Agent for Fraud Analysis (Programming)\n","Build a simple agent that can use Python (Pandas) to answer questions about the transaction data.\n","\n","* **1. Setup and Installation**:\n","    * Install the necessary libraries: `langchain`, `langchain-google-genai`, and `pandas`.\n","    * You will need a Google API key for the Gemini model. Get one from Google AI Studio and configure it in your Colab environment using `userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')`.\n","\n","* **2. Load Data and LLM**:\n","    * Load the `df_enriched_transactions` DataFrame you created in Day 2.\n","    * Instantiate the LLM you will use, for example: `llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=\"gemini-pro\", temperature=0)`.\n","\n","* **3. Create the Pandas Agent**:\n","    * LangChain has a specific agent for interacting with Pandas DataFrames. Create your agent using this constructor:\n","        ```python\n","        from langchain_experimental.agents.agent_toolkits import create_pandas_dataframe_agent\n","        from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType\n","\n","        agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(\n","            llm,\n","            df_enriched_transactions,\n","            agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n","            verbose=True # Set to True to see the agent's thought process\n","        )\n","        ```\n","\n","* **4. Interact with Your Agent**:\n","    * Use the agent to answer questions about your data. Run at least three of the following queries and print the results:\n","        1.  \"How many transactions are there in total?\"\n","        2.  \"What is the total transaction amount for customer C101?\"\n","        3.  \"How many transactions were flagged as fraudulent by rule 1?\"\n","        4.  \"Which customer had the single highest transaction amount, and what was that amount?\"\n","        5.  \"Are there any customers with a 'Gold' tier? If so, list their names.\"\n","\n","#### 1.3 Conceptual Follow-up on Your Agent\n","* Based on the `verbose=True` output, briefly explain the \"Thought-Action-Observation\" loop. What role did the LLM play, and what role did the Pandas/Python tool play in answering your questions?\n","\n","#### 1.4 GenAI Framework Comparison (Conceptual)\n","* Compare the LangChain framework you just used with **one** other major GenAI framework, such as **LlamaIndex** or **Microsoft's Semantic Kernel**. Discuss their differences in terms of:\n","    * **Primary Focus**: What is the main use case each framework is optimized for (e.g., general-purpose agents vs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG))?\n","    * **Core Abstractions**: What are the main building blocks or concepts in each framework (e.g., LangChain's \"Chains\" vs. LlamaIndex's \"Indexes\" or Semantic Kernel's \"Planners\")?\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 2: Real-time Streaming Architecture (Conceptual) 🌊\n","\n","#### 2.1 Azure Streaming Pipeline\n","Design a high-level architecture for ingesting and processing transaction data in real-time on Azure.\n","\n","* **Draw or Describe the Architecture**: List the key Azure services you would use and describe the flow of data between them.\n","    * **Ingestion**: What service would you use to ingest a high-throughput stream of transaction events (the equivalent of Apache Kafka)?\n","    * **Processing**: What service would you use for the real-time processing and application of fraud rules/models (the equivalent of Apache Spark Streaming or Flink)?\n","    * **Sinks (Outputs)**: Where would the processed data go? Define at least two sinks.\n","        * *Example Sink 1: A data warehouse for analytics.*\n","        * *Example Sink 2: A real-time alerting system.*\n","\n","#### 2.2 Stateful Stream Processing\n","Our \"Rule 2: Multiple Transactions in a Short Period\" is a *stateful* operation.\n","\n","* **Define State**: In the context of stream processing, what is \"state\"? Why does this specific rule require it?\n","* **Challenges**: What are the main challenges of managing state in a distributed streaming system (e.g., fault tolerance, scalability)?\n","* **Conceptual Solution**: How do modern stream processing frameworks (like Spark Structured Streaming or Azure Stream Analytics) handle state management conceptually (e.g., checkpointing, state stores)?"],"metadata":{"id":"PMi7ZmL87m1x"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","---\n","SOLUTION\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jKftgZjE8SDJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c3d4b4dd"},"source":["First,

Sequential chains are linear.\n","- **Cycles and Iteration:** LangGraph supports cycles in the graph, enabling iterative processes or loops in the workflow, which is not possible with simple chains.\n","- **Error Handling and Recovery:** The graph structure and state management make it easier to implement sophisticated error handling and potentially resume a workflow from a specific point.\n","- **Modularity and Reusability:** Each node in a LangGraph is a modular component that can be reused in different parts of the same graph or in entirely different graphs.\n","\n","* * *\n","\n","**3. Implementing RAG Systems for Data Retrieval:**\n","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a key pattern for grounding LLMs with proprietary data. Describe the role of **embeddings, vector stores, and retrievers** within a LangChain-based RAG system from a data engineering perspective. How would you ensure the freshness and relevance of the data stored in the vector store, and what strategies would you employ for efficient indexing and querying of millions of documents? 🧠\n","\n","**Answer:**\n","In a LangChain-based RAG system from a data engineering perspective:\n","- **Embeddings:** Embeddings are numerical representations of text (document chunks) created by embedding models. Data engineers are responsible for choosing appropriate embedding models, generating embeddings for the document chunks, and ensuring the embedding process is scalable and efficient.\n","- **Vector Stores:** Vector stores (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate) are databases optimized for storing and querying vector embeddings. Data engineers manage the vector store infrastructure, including choosing the right vector database based on scale, performance, and cost, as well as handling indexing and data loading.\n","- **Retrievers:** Retrievers are components that query the vector store to find relevant document chunks based on a user's query (which is also embedded). Data engineers may configure and optimize retrievers, potentially implementing custom retrieval logic or combining multiple retrieval methods.\n","\n","Ensuring freshness and relevance of data in the vector store:\n","- **Scheduled Updates:** Implement a data pipeline that periodically checks the source data for changes (new documents, updates, deletions) and updates the vector store accordingly.\n","- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** For frequently changing data, use CDC techniques to capture changes in real-time and propagate them to the vector store.\n","- **Version Control:** Maintain versions of documents and their embeddings, allowing for rollback if needed.\n","\n","Strategies for efficient indexing and querying of millions of documents:\n","- **Sharding and Partitioning:** Distribute the vector index across multiple nodes or partitions to handle large volumes and improve query performance.\n","- **Index Optimization:** Utilize techniques like Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) or Product Quantization (PQ) supported by vector databases for faster nearest neighbor search.\n","- **Metadata Indexing:** Index relevant metadata in the vector store to enable pre-filtering of documents before the vector similarity search.\n","- **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data or queries.\n","- **Monitoring and Tuning:** Continuously monitor the performance of the vector store and retriever, tuning parameters as needed.\n","\n","* * *\n","\n","**4. Data Governance and Observability in LLM Applications:**\n","As data engineers, we're accountable for data quality and system reliability.

This helps in understanding data quality issues and ensuring compliance. Custom logging or integration with data lineage tools would be necessary.\n","- **Access Control:** Implement access controls to the vector store and any other data sources used by the LLM application to ensure only authorized users or services can access the data.\n","\n","**Observability:**\n","- **Monitoring Token Usage and Cost:** Monitor the number of tokens consumed by LLM calls to track costs and identify potential inefficiencies. This can often be done through the LLM provider's APIs or by logging token usage within the LangChain/LangGraph application.\n","- **Monitoring Latency and Error Rates:** Track the response time of LLM calls, tool executions, and overall workflow execution to identify performance bottlenecks. Monitor error rates to quickly detect and diagnose issues.
