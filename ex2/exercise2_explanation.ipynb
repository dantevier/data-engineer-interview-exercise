You will enrich transaction data with customer information, implement a basic rule-based fraud detection logic using Python and Pandas, and conceptualize the target database schema and initial ETL steps.\n","\n","#### Scenario\n","Continuing with the \"Real-time Transaction Fraud Detection System,\" you now need to combine the cleaned customer and transaction data. Based on this enriched dataset, you will apply a simple fraud detection rule and prepare the data for storage.\n","\n","#### Data to Use üìä\n","You will use the cleaned Pandas DataFrames, `df_customers` and `df_transactions`, resulting from the Day 1 exercise.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 1: Python/Pandas Implementation üíª\n","\n","#### 1.1 Data Enrichment\n","* **Merge** `df_transactions` with `df_customers` based on `customer_id`.\n","* The merged DataFrame should include relevant customer details such as `customer_name`, `customer_tier`, and `registration_date`.\n","* Name the resulting DataFrame `df_enriched_transactions`.\n","* **Print** the first 5 rows and the `.info()` of `df_enriched_transactions`.\n","\n","#### 1.2 Basic Fraud Rule Implementation\n","* You will implement \"**Rule 1: High Transaction Value for New Customers**\".\n","* Define a \"**new customer**\" as someone whose `registration_date` is within the last 7 days relative to the latest timestamp in `df_transactions`.\n","* Define a \"**high transaction value**\" as an `amount` greater than $500.\n","* Create a new boolean column, `is_fraudulent_rule1`, in `df_enriched_transactions` that is `True` if both conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.\n","* **Count and print** the number of transactions flagged by this rule.\n","* **Display** the `transaction_id`, `customer_id`, `amount`, `timestamp`, and `is_fraudulent_rule1` for the flagged transactions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Part 2: Conceptual Questions ü§î\n","\n","#### 2.1 Conceptual ETL Pipeline Design & SQL Considerations\n","\n","Based on the `df_enriched_transactions` DataFrame, describe your design for the following.\n","\n","* **Target Database Schema** üóÉÔ∏è:\n","    * `dim_customer` table with columns: `customer_sk` (Surrogate Key, INTEGER, Primary Key), `customer_id` (VARCHAR, Unique), `customer_name` (VARCHAR), `customer_email` (VARCHAR), `registration_date` (DATE), `customer_tier` (VARCHAR), `last_login_date` (DATE).\n","    * `fact_transactions` table with columns: `transaction_sk` (Surrogate Key, INTEGER, Primary Key), `transaction_id` (VARCHAR, Unique), `customer_sk` (INTEGER, Foreign Key to `dim_customer`), `amount` (DECIMAL), `timestamp` (DATETIME), `currency` (VARCHAR), `ip_address` (VARCHAR), `transaction_hour` (INTEGER), `is_fraudulent_rule1` (BOOLEAN).\n","    * `fact_fraud_events` table for flagged transactions with columns: `fraud_event_sk` (Surrogate Key, INTEGER, Primary Key), `transaction_sk` (INTEGER, Foreign Key to `fact_transactions`), `rule_id` (VARCHAR), `detection_timestamp` (DATETIME), `severity` (VARCHAR).\n","\n","* **ETL Steps** ‚öôÔ∏è (Describe in Markdown or with pseudocode):\n","    * **Extraction**: How would you conceptually extract the `df_enriched_transactions` data for loading?\n","    * **Transformation (`dim_customer`)**: How would you manage new vs. existing customers in the `dim_customer` table (e.g., INSERT vs. UPDATE)? What SQL operations would be needed?\n","    * **Transformation (`fact_transactions`)**: How would you look up the `customer_sk` from `dim_customer`? What SQL operations would be required for this table?\n","    * **Transformation (`fact_fraud_events`)**: How would you select only the flagged transactions to populate this table, including the `rule_id` and `detection_timestamp`?\n","    * **Loading**: How would you conceptually load the transformed data into the target tables?\n","\n","#### 2.2 Edge Cases & Robustness\n","\n","* **Edge Case 1: Referential Integrity Violation** ‚ö†Ô∏è:\n","    * A `customer_id` in `df_transactions` does not exist in `df_customers` (e.g., 'C999' from the sample data). Describe how a robust ETL pipeline should handle this (e.g., left join and identify unmatched, quarantine data, or use a default customer record).\n","\n","* **Edge Case 2: Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)** ‚è≥:\n","    * Imagine a customer's `customer_tier` can change, and you must preserve the historical tier for past transactions. Explain conceptually how you would modify the `dim_customer` table and the ETL process to support SCD Type 2 (e.g., by adding `start_date`, `end_date`, and `is_current` columns)."],"metadata":{"id":"_k7nU4nuWIwM"}}]}
